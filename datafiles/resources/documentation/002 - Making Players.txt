002 - MAKING       PLAYERS
==========================

(wip)

== SECTION 002a: OVERVIEW ==

Making a custom player is a fairly simple process, especially compared to making a level. You can find player data in "resources/players". All you need to do is replace files and tweak attributes.json if you need to. Filenames make the process self-explanatory.


main_sprite.png  : The sprite sheet for the player. Make sure it's horizontal.
mask.png         : The collision mask or hitbox of the player. Make sure it's symmetrical, because you could end up clipping through walls if it's not.
Audio files      : The sounds for various movements and actions, all self-explanatory. Make sure the files are .ogg, however!
Footsteps folder : Drop all footstep noises here. Filenames don't matter, just make sure they're .ogg.



== SECTION 002b: ATTRIBUTES ==

If you want to tweak gameplay-related things or animations, you'll have to edit the attributes.json file.


"name"         : String (The name of the player in the player select)
"jump_delay"   : Number (The delay in ANIMATION FRAMES before the player leaves the ground. Set to 0 if you want no delay)
"anim_frames"  : Number (The total amount of frame slices in the sprite sheet)
"bonk_delay"   : Number (The amount of ANIMATION FRAMES it takes before the player unsticks from the ceiling after bonking it)
"anim" Arrays  : Array (Lists containing the frames for each animation. Keep in mind the frames start at 0, so the first frame would be 0, second would be 1, and so on.)
"move_speed"   : Number (The speed in which the player runs. Fine-tune to your liking.)
"jump_height"  : Number (The force applied to the player when you jump.)
"friction"     : Number (From 0.0 to 1.0, controls your speed damping. 1.0 makes you start/stop moving instantly while lower numbers give you a smoother, more slippery effect)
"hp"           : Number (The amount of hits it takes for you to die)
